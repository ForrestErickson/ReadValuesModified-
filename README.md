# ReadValuesModified 
Is a sketch baised on ReadValues from the DFPlayer library examples.  
It has been modified to try to understand how the class methods return values.  

## Function Detials
It workes poorly with DFPlayer.   

It works poorly but different with TD5580A mini MP3 players. In particular with the TD5580A mini MP3 player the sketch can detect SD card in the connector or not. So for the SD card detection it works better than with the DFPlayer.
